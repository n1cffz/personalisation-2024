### Understanding Spotifyâ€™s Recommendation Radio System: A content and user-based analysis. ðŸŽ¶
Ever wondered why Spotify suggests certain songs to you? This project takes a deep dive into Spotify's recommendation system to uncover what influences these suggestions. Through an exploratory analysis, weâ€™ll look at:

- Personal Listening History: How does Spotify use your past listening to make recommendations?
- Algorithm Biases: Are there any biases or limitations in the way recommendations are made?
- Audio Features & Song Popularity: How do factors like song features and popularity impact what you hear?
- For the full details, check out the Project Write-Up.
